Coffee Quality Analysis Project


Description
This project analyzes coffee quality data collected from various coffee farms across multiple countries to uncover insights about factors influencing coffee grades and sensory attributes. The dataset contains detailed information on coffee origins, varieties, processing methods, and sensory scores such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and overall quality. The main goal is to explore patterns and correlations within the data to better understand what drives coffee quality.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 207 coffee samples from 22 countries, including Taiwan, Guatemala, Colombia, Honduras, and others.

Key features include sensory scores (aroma, flavor, acidity, body, balance), coffee variety (e.g., Gesha, Caturra), processing method (e.g., Washed/Wet, Natural/Dry), altitude, producer info, and total cup points.

Scores for attributes range mostly between 6.5 and 8.6 with uniformity, clean cup, and sweetness scoring near perfect (around 10).

Total cup points indicate a coffee quality range from lower to high specialty grades (approx. 78 to 89 points).

Objectives
Identify main countries of origin and popular coffee varieties in the dataset.

Explore common processing methods and their distribution.

Calculate average sensory scores and assess correlations between attributes.

Understand factors that strongly influence overall coffee quality.

Provide insights that could assist coffee producers, buyers, and researchers with better quality assessment.

Methodology
Data analysis includes descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and frequency counts.

Sensory attributes are analyzed to establish relationships with overall quality scores.

Visualizations such as bar charts, correlation heatmaps, and distribution plots help interpret patterns.

Data processing done using Python with libraries such as pandas for analysis.

File Structure
coffee_quality.csv: The main dataset used for analysis containing coffee sample details and sensory scores.

Analysis scripts and visualizations (if applicable) - to be included in respective folders.

Key Findings
Taiwan contributes the highest number of coffee samples in this dataset.

Gesha and Caturra are the most prevalent coffee varieties.

Washed/Wet processing is the dominant method among the coffees sampled.

Strong positive correlations exist between flavor, aftertaste, balance, and the overall coffee quality rating.

Uniformity, clean cup, and sweetness remain consistently high across samples, indicating standard quality checks.

Usage
This dataset and analysis can be used to benchmark coffee quality attributes.

Coffee producers may use insights to refine processing or growing conditions.

Researchers can extend the analysis by applying machine learning models for quality prediction.

Limitations
Dataset is limited to samples primarily from select countries, which may affect generalizability.

Sensory scores are subjective and might vary by grading panel or evaluation method.

Additional environmental or agronomic factors could further enhance analysis.
